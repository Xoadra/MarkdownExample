# Markdown Example

This is a repo for testing the sourcing of markdown content remotely using Gatsby and GitHub's GraphQL API.  It will include example frontmatter in addition to other markdown features like a table of contents and whatnot to make sure that all kinds of markdown properties are being parsed correctly and safely.

This line was added using the GitHub API from my TypeScriptGatsby project!  Another sentence was added to see if this updated document was saved into state!

More to come soon!
