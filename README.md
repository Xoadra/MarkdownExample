# Markdown Example

This is a repo for testing the sourcing of markdown conent remotely using Gatsby and GitHub's GraphQL API.  It will include example frontmatter in addition to other markdown fetures like a table of contents and whatnot to make sure that all kinds of markdown properties are being parsed correctly and safely.

More to come soon!
